# Breast_Cancer_Classification_Python_ML
In this project we analyzed the Breast Cancer Dataset. The dataset contains various measurements of breast which can be used as an indicators to check whether the person has the cancer or not. Then after thoroughly cleaning the data we standardize the data to feed it to the ML Random Forest algo. Then we try to predict the person has cancer or not.
